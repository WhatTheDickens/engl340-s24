<!-- ## Assignment: Fluid-text TEI

Look over the TEI file for the "Solitude" chapter that you downloaded from GitHub. It's chock full of markup, and it makes for pretty intimidating reading at first. Don't be scared off. Scroll down to the first paragraph. Compare what you see there with [the rendered text of the paragraph in Digital Thoreau's fluid-text edition of](http://digitalthoreau.org/walden/fluid/text/05.html) *[Walden](http://digitalthoreau.org/walden/fluid/text/05.html).* Then record some thoughts here about what the different tags mean. This exercise isn't about getting anything right. You're just seeing what you can figure out without having any expertise in this new language.

Record your thoughts by 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, April 22.
