              <witness xml:id="nicolay">Named for Lincoln's presidential aid John Nicolay, this copy is usually considered the first draft of address Lincoln delivered on November 19, 1863.</witness>
              <witness xml:id="hay">Named for Lincoln's presidential aid John Hay, this copy most closely matches the text reported in newspaper accounts of the address that Lincoln delivererd on November 19, 1863, but seems unlikely to be the reading text because it is not folded.</witness>
              <witness xml:id="bancroft">Copy produced for historian George Bancroft, intended to be sold for a sanitary fair in Baltimore, from early 1864.</witness>
              <witness xml:id="everett">Copy produced for Sen. Edward Everett (who also spoke at Gettysburg), from February 1864, intended to be sold as a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Sanitary Fair.</witness>
