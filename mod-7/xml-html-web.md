# XML, HTML, and the Web

In the previous module, we looked at XML encoding&mdash;in particular, the XML standard TEI&mdash;as a tool for digital scholarly editing. The XML/TEI markup language enables us to *say things about textual data*&mdash;how the text on a manuscript page is structured, for example, or how the text of one draft of an author's work differs from the text of another, or what an author's marks on a manuscript page might tell us about an author's revisions to their text.

For this reason, XML/TEI is sometimes referred to as a form of *descriptive markup*. It enables us to describe textual data (and other types of data, such as images). What it doesn't do is to tell a browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, or Edge, *how to display the data as a web page*. For that purpose, we need some kind of *presentational* markup language, such as HTML.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the basic language of the web. The fluid-text edition of *Walden* we looked at earlier uses HTML to display the TEI-encoded information about differences between Thoreau's draft versions and changes Thoreau made to the manuscript (insertions, cancellations, etc.) in your browser.

It's time for us to turn away for a bit from XML/TEI to explore HTML. Doing so will give us a chance to think further about how digital technology has transformed writing, publication, and reading. It will also give us a chance to explore some fundamental aspects of computing.

We'll begin with the internet itself: where it came from, what it is, and how it's related to the web.
