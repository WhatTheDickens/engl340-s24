# Dates and Activities

## Monday, March 25

### Before class

- Read *Walden*, "The Ponds," "Baker Farm," "Higher Laws."

### In class

- We'll discuss *Walden* and explore images of the *Walden* manuscript.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 3-25, share your journal file for the day with notes on any thoughts you have about the* Walden *manuscript images. In addition, leave a comment in the margin of any part of* Walden *assigned for today that makes you curious to know more about how that passage might have changed during Thoreau's composition process.*

## Wednesday, March 27

### Before class

- Read *Walden*, "Brute Neighbors," "House-Warming," and "Former Inhabitants; and Winter Visitors."
- Review [Attributes, Links, Images]({{ site.url }}/mod-7/attributes-links-images) in the previous module.

### In class

- We'll discuss *Walden* and play with incorporating images into web pages.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 3-27, share your journal file for the day with notes on incorporating images into web pages. In addition, just as you did on 3-25, leave a comment in the margin of any part of* Walden *assigned for today that makes you curious to know more about how that passage might have changed during Thoreau's composition process.*

## Friday, March 29

- Group 4 meeting.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 3-29, share your journal file for the day with reflections on your own composition process. How does it compare to what you're seeing of Thoreau's composition process? On a scale from "totally scattershot" to "highly organized and intentional," where would you place your own composition process? If it's anything other than "totally scattershot," what are some of the things you do to make your own process at least somewhat organized and intentional? What role do you think technology has played in the difference between Thoreau's process and your own? Comparing Thoreau's process to your own, what aspects of revision seem to have been relatively untouched by technological change?*
