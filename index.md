# Meet the Course

## What it's about

Welcome to ENGL 340, Spring 2024, *Literature and Literary Study in the Digital Age*.

In this course, we'll work together to understand how computers have changed the field of possibilities for studying books&mdash;in particular, books of the kind usually classified as "literature."

To do this, we'll need some base level of understanding for the two parts of this equation: computers on the one hand, books on the other. *Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet*, by Claire L. Evans, will help us establish a base-level understanding of computers that's not just technical but historical. *The Book*, by Amaranth Borsuk, will do the same for us with books. 

We'll also need a book that we can keep coming back to in order to test what computers can help us do with literature. *Walden*, by Henry David Thoreau, will be that book. Because *Walden* is a book that's partly about technology, in which the author also has some provocative things to say about literature, it will also help us think more broadly about the relationship between books and computers.

Finally, everyone will need to have a working computer running the software required to do the things we want them to do with literature. Specifically, you'll need a laptop running a reasonably up-to-date version of Windows, macOS, or Linux. Chromebooks, tablets, and phones won't suffice. You'll need to bring your laptop to every class. If your laptop breaks down or is lost or stolen, you'll need to find a substitute.
